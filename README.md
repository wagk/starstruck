# Starstruck (Bevy ver.)

We use [`bevy_egui`][1], but we really will be referring to [`egui`][2] more
often.

# Roadmap (Tentative)

- [ ] Attach a camera to a "spaceship" (read: rectangle) and let us drive it
      around.
- [ ] Investigate stage modals and how egui + bevy handles them.
  - [ ] Make levels restartable
  - [ ] Print debug variables and sightlines.
